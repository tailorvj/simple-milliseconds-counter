# Simple Milliseconds Counter

The simplest webpage possible to count milliseconds on screen. 
We are using it for FullPageOS experimental purposes, when running a 
playlist with various durations. 
It is being deployed to Heroku and/or locally and run from there 
with the ?bgcolor=color parameter, to easily distinguish between 
different URLs and see how many milliseconds have passed since 
the page has been loaded. 

FullPageOS experimental allows you to define a URL playlist, with 
a duration for each item. This tools allows us to test that the 
duration is actually being respected by the player.
